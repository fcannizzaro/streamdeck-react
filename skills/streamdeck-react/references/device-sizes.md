# Device Sizes

The library automatically detects the device type and sets render dimensions. Use `useCanvas()` to access dimensions in components.

## Key Sizes

| Device | Key Size (px) |
|--------|--------------|
| Stream Deck (original) | 72 x 72 |
| Stream Deck MK.2 | 72 x 72 |
| Stream Deck XL | 96 x 96 |
| Stream Deck Mini | 80 x 80 |
| Stream Deck + | 144 x 144 |
| Stream Deck Neo | 72 x 72 |

## Encoder Display Sizes (Stream Deck+)

| Surface | Size (px) |
|---------|----------|
| Encoder display (per action) | 200 x 100 |

## Touch Input

The Stream Deck+ touch strip is 800 x 100 across the full device. Touch events are routed per encoder action, so coordinates are relative to that action's segment.

## Grid Sizes

| Device | Columns | Rows |
|--------|---------|------|
| Stream Deck (original) | 5 | 3 |
| Stream Deck MK.2 | 5 | 3 |
| Stream Deck XL | 8 | 4 |
| Stream Deck Mini | 3 | 2 |
| Stream Deck + | 4 | 2 |
| Stream Deck Neo | 4 | 2 |

## Design Guidelines

- Design for the smallest target size (72x72) and let larger keys have more breathing room.
- Use `useCanvas()` to adapt layouts dynamically:
  ```tsx
  const { width, height, type } = useCanvas();
  ```
- Text below ~10px fontSize becomes hard to read on 72x72 keys.
- Stream Deck XL's 96x96 keys allow more detailed layouts.
- Stream Deck+ 144x144 keys support rich multi-element designs.
- Encoder displays (200x100) are wider than tall -- use horizontal layouts.
